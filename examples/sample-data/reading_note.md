# How Big Things Get Done

*From Bent Flyvbjerg & Dan Gardner*

## The Planning Fallacy at Scale

Most big projects fail -- not because of bad luck, but because of bad planning. Flyvbjerg's research across thousands of megaprojects shows a consistent pattern: optimistic timelines, underestimated costs, and overestimated benefits. The root cause is almost always the same: planners build estimates from the "inside view" instead of looking at base rates.

## Think Slow, Act Fast

The counterintuitive insight: the best projects spend an unusually long time in planning and an unusually short time in execution. The worst projects rush to start and then get bogged down in problems that should have been anticipated.

> "The first thing you do is the last thing you should do."

This means: resist the pressure to "just get started." Use the planning phase to identify risks, run experiments, and build modularity into the design.

## Reference-Class Forecasting

Instead of building bottom-up estimates, look at how similar projects actually performed. Your project is not unique -- the base rate of comparable projects is a far better predictor than your team's optimistic scenario.

Flyvbjerg's data shows that 9 out of 10 megaprojects exceed their budget. The average cost overrun is 62%.

## Modularity as Risk Management

Projects built from modular, repeatable components (like IKEA furniture or solar farms) dramatically outperform bespoke, one-of-a-kind designs. Modularity enables:
- Learning curves (each module is cheaper/faster than the last)
- Parallel execution (teams work simultaneously)
- Graceful degradation (one module fails, others continue)

## Key Insight

The single best predictor of project success is not the team, the budget, or the technology -- it's whether the project was planned with reference-class forecasting and modular design.

## Application
- Apply reference-class forecasting to [[Atlas_AI_Initiative]] timeline estimates
- Discuss modularity principle with [[Weber_Marcus|Marcus]] for the search rewrite architecture
- Use "think slow, act fast" as framework for next sprint planning
