# Reference-Class Forecasting

## Principle
The most reliable way to predict the outcome of a project is to look at how similar projects actually performed, rather than building estimates from the inside out.

## Key Disciplines
1. **Outside View First:** Before estimating anything, find 5-10 comparable projects and check their actual timelines, budgets, and outcomes.
2. **Anchor on Base Rates:** Your project is not special. The base rate of similar projects is a better predictor than your gut feeling.
3. **Adjust for Uniqueness Last:** Only after anchoring on the outside view, adjust for truly unique factors. Most "unique" factors aren't.
4. **Premortem Integration:** Ask "If this project fails, what's the most likely reason?" -- then check if reference projects failed for the same reasons.
5. **Track Your Calibration:** Keep a log of your estimates vs. actuals. Most people are systematically overconfident by 30-50%.
